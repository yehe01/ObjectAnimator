## Caution
ObjectAnimator is an experimental library written in Swift. The library starts as a direct port of Android's anmations.ObjectAnimator. Along with the development, generics are introduced to avoid duplicate logic as in Android's ObjectAnimator. It can be used as a start point to develop full-blown ObjectAnimator to coordinate animation on custom object. Contributions are highly welcome.

# ObjectAnimatorExample
